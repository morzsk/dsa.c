## My Implementation of Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains my implementations of various data structures and algorithms using C. The goal of this project is to develop a deeper understanding of core concepts in data structures and algorithms.

## Array
- [x] **Stack**: Implementation of a LIFO (Last In, First Out) stack.
- [x] **Queue**: Implementation of a FIFO (First In, First Out) queue.
- [x] **Deque**: Implementation of a double-ended queue.

## Linked List
- [x] **Singly Linked List**: A linked list where each node points to the next node, and the last node points to `NULL`.
- [x] **Doubly Linked List**: A linked list where each node contains pointers to both the previous and next nodes.
- [ ] **Circular Linked List**: A linked list where the last node points back to the head node, forming a circle.

## Tree
- [ ] **Binary Tree**: A hierarchical structure where each node has at most two children.
- [ ] **Heap**: A specialized tree-based data structure satisfying the heap property.

## Graph

Implementation for graph-related algorithms is yet to be added.

## Hash Structures
- [ ] **Hash Table**: A data structure that maps keys to values for efficient lookup.
- [ ] **Hash Map**: A hash-based key-value pair data structure.
- [ ] **Hash Set**: A hash-based data structure to store unique elements.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/morzsk/dsa.c.git
   ```
2. Compile the source code using gnumake compiler:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./dsa
   ```
